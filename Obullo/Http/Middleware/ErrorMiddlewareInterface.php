 * Middleware for handling errors.

 * one key distinction: it has an additional argument prepended, representing
 * an error condition.
 *
 * `Next` will skip error middleware if called without an error; conversely,
 * if called with an error, it will skip normal middleware.
 *
 * Error middleware does something with the arguments passed, and then
 * either returns a response, or calls `$out`, with or without the error.
